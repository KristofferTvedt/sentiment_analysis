# Abstract
This research paper focuses on exploring data generated from the 2021 European Commission proposal for the AI Act, specifically analyzing the sentiment expressed by businesses and NGOs. The AI Act is a legislative framework proposed by the European Parliament to address the challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence within the European Union. The paper aims to compare the stances of businesses and NGOs on the AI Act and identify the most frequently used positive and negative terms by these groups. The research questions seek to understand the differences in sentiment between the two actor groups and shed light on their perspectives on the proposed legislation.

To conduct the analysis, the paper employs principles of discovery and measurement. Discovery involves uncovering patterns, trends, and structures in the textual data. Measurement, on the other hand, involves quantifying specific aspects of the text, such as word frequencies and sentiment scores, enabling objective analysis and comparison.

The dataset used in this study comprises PDF submissions from various stakeholders, including AI developers, companies, public administrations, academics, and citizens. The data cleaning process involved addressing issues with actor types, removing non-English documents, and filtering the dataset to focus on documents from businesses and NGOs. The analysis of the cleaned dataset revealed distinct patterns in word usage, reflecting the different priorities and concerns of businesses and NGOs.

Furthermore, the paper applies the Wordfish methodology to measure the ideologica positions of actors based on their word usage. Wordfish allows for the quantification and comparison of ideological positions by examining patterns of language usage. This approach provides insights into the underlying perspectives of businesses and NGOs regarding the AI Act. The findings from this research contribute to understanding the sentiments and perspectives of businesses and NGOs towards the proposed AI Act. The analysis reveals the distinct characteristics and objectives of these actor groups, highlighting their different priorities and concerns. The research also provides valuable insights into the most frequently used positive and negative terms by businesses and NGOs, shedding light on their perceptions of the proposed legislation.

Overall, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse surrounding the AI Act and its implications for businesses, NGOs, and the European Union as a whole. By analyzing the sentiment expressed by these actor groups, policymakers and stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of the potential impact and challenges associated with the proposed legislation.
